Hi, i'm @Elektriman

My real name is Julien Crambes and i'm 21 years old.
I'm a french computer science student looking for learning advanced python mecanisms and improve my coding level overall.
I'm also a number theory enthusiast and I'm really into anything that's related to science overall, even if I have a preference for space exploration and artificial intelligence.
